This Project was made in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, so you may need to import it to that as a project to run.
The ifstream and ofstream used to read and write the input and output files only worked with a full file path, so it will need to be adjusted to point to the local files on your computer once downloaded.
If it is pointed to a different input file, it will overwrite the output_file with the new maze. The code supports mazes up to a size of 20x20 squares.
